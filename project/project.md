## Abstract

By the end of 2019, healthcare across the world started to see a new type of Flu and they called it Coronavirus or Covid-19. This new type of Flu developed across the world and it appeared there is no one treatment could be used to treat it yet, scientists found different treatments that apply to different age ranges. In this project, We will try to work on comparison analysis between USA and China on number of new cases and new deaths and trying to find factors played big roles in this spread.

## 1. Introduction

While the world is ready to start 2020 we heard about a new type of the Flu that it appears to be started in China and from there it went to the entire world. It appeared to affect all ages but its severity did depend on other factors that related to age, health conditions if the patient is a smoker or not?

This new disease attacked aggressively the respiratory system for the patient and then all the human body causing death. The recovery from this disease appeared to vary from area to area across the globe, Also the death percentage as well was and still vary from area to area. 

## 2. Data-Sets

We will use the data set provided by [1-3] and we will try to observe more data sets so we can get a better understanding of what is the relationship between the COVID 19 spread and the most affected areas. Currently looks like we are getting a second wave of coronavirus and so we will try to get the most recent data.

We will collect the data and extract it from its sources and datasets, Also we will look for the most recent data as well, and we will compare and do analysis on the findings and draw the most apropriate conclusion accordingly.

## 3. Methodology

We will be utilizing the Indiana University system to process the collected data as it will need a strong system to process it. Also, we will utilize Python, and Jupyter notebook as programming software and platform.
After observing the data from multiple websites, we decided to use the dataset from the World Health Organization. After looking through the data we decided to perform the analysis between the USA and China on the total number of new COVID 19 cases and total number of new COVID 19 related deaths on a monthly basis starting from January 2020.
We started with using Python code for the programing and working on the csv file downloaded from the WHO website, and utilizing matplotlib for visualization purposes.
