## Abstract

By the end of 2019, healthcare across the world started to see a new type of Flu and they called it Coronavirus or Covid-19. This new type of Flu developed across the world and it appeared there is no one treatment could be used to treat it yet, scientists found different treatments that apply to different age ranges. In this project, We will try to work on comparison analysis between USA and China on number of new cases and new deaths and trying to find factors played big roles in this spread.

## 1. Introduction

While the world is ready to start 2020 we heard about a new type of the Flu that it appears to be started in China and from there it went to the entire world. It appeared to affect all ages but its severity did depend on other factors that related to age, health conditions if the patient is a smoker or not?

This new disease attacked aggressively the respiratory system for the patient and then all the human body causing death. The recovery from this disease appeared to vary from area to area across the globe, Also the death percentage as well was and still vary from area to area. 

## 2. Data-Sets

We will use http://datatopics.worldbank.org/universal-health-coverage/coronavirus/  also https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge as data sets, we will try to observe more data sets so we can get a better understanding of what relates between the coronavirus spread and the most affected areas. Currently looks like we are getting a second wave of coronavirus and so we will try to get the most recent data.

We will collect the data and extract it from its sources and datasets, Also we will look for the most recent data as well and we will compare and do analysis on the founding and get the best conclusion accordingly.

## 3. Methodology

We will be utilizing the Indiana University system to process the collected data as it will need a strong system to process it. Also, we will utilize Python, Collab, and Jupyter notebook as programming software.
After observing the data from multiple websits, we decided to use the dataset from the World Health Organization and we did looked through the data then we are going to do the analysis between USA and China on the total new cases and total new deaths monthly starting from 1/1/2020.
We started with using Python code for the programing and working on the csv file downloaded from the WHO website, and utilizing matplotlib for the visualization piece.
