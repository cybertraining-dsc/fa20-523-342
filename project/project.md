## 1. Introduction

While the world is ready to start 2020 we heard about a new type of the Flu that it appears to be started in China and from there it went to the entire world. It appeared to affect all ages but its severity did depend on other factors that related to age, health conditions if the patient is a smoker or not?

This new disease attacked aggressively the respiratory system for the patient and then all the human body causing death. The recovery from this disease appeared to vary from area to area across the globe, Also the death percentage as well was and still vary from area to area. 

## 2. Data-Sets

We will use http://datatopics.worldbank.org/universal-health-coverage/coronavirus/  also https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge as data sets, we will try to observe more data sets so we can get a better understanding of what relates between the coronavirus spread and the most affected areas. Currently looks like we are getting a second wave of coronavirus and so we will try to get the most recent data.

We will collect the data and extract it from its sources and datasets, Also we will look for the most recent data as well and we will compare and do analysis on the founding and get the best conclusion accordingly.

## 3. Methodology

We will be utilizing the Indiana University system to process the collected data as it will need a strong system to process it. Also, we will utilize Python, Collab, and Jupyter notebook as programming software.
